TEXT TO POTENTIALLY DRAW UPON - This is pulled from the other documents I provided but just putting it here for convenience:

Addressing The Discipleship Crisis: eciple was founded to address the most urgent and impactful challenge facing the Church today: the pervasive problem of ineffective discipleship models.
The Discipleship Crisis: The Church faces a significant crisis driven by ineffective discipleship. The current model, with over 90% of ‘discipleship’ efforts focused on a content-heavy approach delivered in group settings, is largely ineffective for facilitating deep spiritual maturity and life change. This ineffectiveness significantly hinders spiritual growth and maturity among believers, which in turn fuels high rates of new Christians falling away, young adults leaving the faith, a growing abandonment of core Christian doctrines, and widespread feelings among believers of inadequacy and frustration due to a lack of spiritual growth and change.
The Proven Model: Extensive research and feedback from pastors and Christians consistently affirm that one-to-one discipleship is the most impactful and sought-after discipleship model. A significant majority of pastors (77%) view mentoring as the core aim of discipleship, and born-again Christians identify one-on-one mentoring as the most influential catalyst for personal spiritual growth and change.
The Problem: Despite overwhelming evidence for its effectiveness, a vast majority of Christians (83%) have never participated in a one-to-one discipleship program primarily due to the complete absence of enabling one-to-one discipleship technology, forcing churches to rely on manual, labor-intensive, and high-cost processes that are impossible to implement at scale.
Introducing eciple: Launched in April 2025 after extensive research, development, and capital investments, the eciple ‘Discipleship Enablement Platform’ is the first comprehensive technology of its kind to centralize all critical functionalities within an intuitive user experience. It provides integrated tools for custom program and content creation, empowering ministries to easily create, deploy, and manage one-to-one discipleship programs at scale
Slogan: Igniting Spiritual Growth, One Relationship at a Time
Note: For public communication I like using text that describes what we are are talking when we say “one-to-one discipleship” using something along the lines of “the one-to-one mentoring model of discipleship” as I feel this makes it more clear to the average person
