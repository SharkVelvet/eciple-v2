Addressing The Discipleship Crisis
eciple was founded to address the most urgent and impactful challenge facing the Church today: the pervasive problem of ineffective discipleship models.
Content-heavy, group discipleship, (90% of all efforts), is ineffective and a primary driver of alarming deterioration across The Church.
The most effective model (80% Pastors) —relationship-driven, one-to-one mentoring—is inaccessible due to the absence of technology.
