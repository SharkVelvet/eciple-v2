# Production API Debug

## Issue Found
Your live Kinsta site is returning the old API format:
```json
[{...documents...}]
```

Instead of the new format with documents wrapper:
```json
{"documents": [{...documents...}]}
```

## Root Cause
The production.js file on Kinsta hasn't been updated with the new API endpoint format.

## Solution
The deployment may be cached or delayed. Try:
1. Force rebuild on Kinsta dashboard
2. Check if git push was successful
3. Clear any deployment caches

## Expected API Response
Should return:
```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": 9,
      "title": "This is a Test 12",
      "filename": "new-document.pdf",
      "description": "Document description",
      "displayOrder": 0,
      "isActive": true,
      "createdAt": "2025-06-26T02:19:32.102Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-06-26T02:28:46.458Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
