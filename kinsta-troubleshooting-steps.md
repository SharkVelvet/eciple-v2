# Kinsta Database Connection Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- Database contains 3 active documents ready for display
- Admin credentials properly configured in database
- Production server updated with correct PostgreSQL drivers

## Next Steps

### 1. Push Latest Changes
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add server/production.js
git commit -m "Add environment variable logging for database troubleshooting"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify Kinsta Application Connection
- Ensure "Add connection" was completed in Kinsta dashboard
- Check that eciple.kin appears in "Connected applications"
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is either:
  - Automatically set by Kinsta connection, OR
  - Removed completely to avoid conflicts

### 3. Check Application Logs
After deployment, check Kinsta application logs for:
- "Environment variables check" output
- Database connection success/error messages
- Any startup errors

### 4. Test Endpoints
Once connection is established:
- https://eciple-kin-05g9p.kinsta.app/api/eciple-documents
- Admin login: https://eciple-kin-05g9p.kinsta.app/admin-login

## Expected Resolution
The automatic Kinsta connection should provide seamless database access without manual configuration.
