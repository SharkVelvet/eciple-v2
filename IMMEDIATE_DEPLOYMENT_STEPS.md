# Immediate Admin Login Fix - Manual Deployment Required

## Current Status
✅ Local authentication works: Returns valid session tokens
❌ Production returns: `{"error":"Invalid credentials"}`

## Solution: Manual GitHub Deployment

Since git operations are locked, deploy through GitHub web interface:

### Step 1: Go to GitHub
1. Visit: https://github.com/SharkVelvet/eciple
2. Navigate to `server/production.js`
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)

### Step 2: Replace File Contents
Replace the entire `server/production.js` file with the working version from this Replit environment.

### Step 3: Commit and Deploy
1. Scroll down to commit section
2. Add message: "Deploy admin authentication fix"
3. Click "Commit changes"
4. Redeploy your Kinsta application

### Step 4: Test Login
After redeployment, test:
```bash
curl -X POST https://eciple-kin-05g9p.kinsta.app/api/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "eciple_admin_2024", "password": "EcipleSecure2024Admin!@#$%^&*()_+"}'
```

Should return session token instead of "Invalid credentials"

### Your Credentials
- Username: `eciple_admin_2024`
- Password: `EcipleSecure2024Admin!@#$%^&*()_+`

The authentication system is ready and tested - it just needs manual deployment to production.
