# Immediate Deployment Fix

## Problem
GitHub deployment taking too long and likely failing.

## Fast Solution Options:

### Option 1: Direct Kinsta File Manager
1. Log into Kinsta MyKinsta dashboard
2. Go to your application â†’ File Manager
3. Navigate to `server/production.js`
4. Replace file content directly with fixed version
5. Restart application

### Option 2: Manual Git Push
If you have git access locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SharkVelvet/eciple.git
cd eciple
# Replace server/production.js with fixed version
git add server/production.js
git commit -m "Fix admin authentication"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Force Redeploy
In Kinsta dashboard:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click "Redeploy" to force a fresh deployment
3. This might pick up any GitHub changes

## Test After Any Fix:
```bash
curl -X POST https://eciple-kin-05g9p.kinsta.app/api/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "eciple_admin_2024", "password": "EcipleSecure2024Admin!@#$%^&*()_+"}'
```

Should return session token instead of "Invalid credentials"
